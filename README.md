# Goliath Toolhead with Klicky or Beacon

This toolhead is for the Goliath hotend. if uses:
- Hextrudort or LGX lite extruder or any other extruder with matching screw holes
- CPAP only, no fan mod 
- either Beacon 3D or Klicky / Unklicky / other klicky like probes
- MGN12 rail only
- “simple” umbilical cord

The toolhead need to be printed “up-side-down”, which minimises the supports needed. I use PrusaSlicer with tree supports. Other settings at your discretion, but I like to play it save, so better more perimeters, more infill etc.

v1.7.2
- optimised duct so it would print dual-wall with a 0.6 nozzle
- slightly optimised heat insert cut-out

v1.7.1 improvment 
- added small air guiding restirctions to better cool the hotend

v1.7 improvments
- the goliath and extruder a pulled in 3mm, thereby pulling in the center of gravity
- redesigned stabiliser struts, so no supports are required for printing then
- those changes in turn required a redesign of the fan duct, which now also contains holes for heat inserts to secure it to the toolhead
- a clamp for the CPAP tube, which also contains the ADXL mount
- made some room on the back side of the toolhead and extruder adapter, to possibly and permanently mount an ADXL

I am keeping v1.6 as an older version, as the clearance on that is a bit more. Just in case / as per personal taste.
