# Goliath Toolhead with Klicky or Beacon

This toolhead is for the Goliath hotend. if uses:
- Hextrudort or LGX lite extruder or any other extruder with matching screw holes
- CPAP only, no fan mod 
- either Beacon 3D or Klicky / Unklicky / other klicky like probes
- MGN12 rail only
- “simple” umbilical cord

The toolhead need to be printed “up-side-down”, which minimises the supports needed and supports are inlcuded in the part, so no slicer support required. Other settings at your discretion, but I like to play it save, so better more perimeters, more infill etc.


v1.9
- a stronger top cage was added to decrease vibration by securing cables and tube with zip-ties
- 1-strut-version of toolhead was omitted vor the same reason. 
- the strong / stiff top cage currently only works with Hextrudort! One can still use version 1.8 with the lighter top and umbilical cord mount with other extruders.
**v1.9 toolhead does not work with earlier versions of umbilical or hextrudort adapter!**
**one needs to print Hex_adapter_w_cage, which is now one part.**

v1.8.2 > 1 strut version
v1.8.1 > 2 strut version

v1.8.x
- moved the goliath and extruder up 2mm and used 1mm of that increased space to thicken the complete back plate of the toolhead
- improved stability and air flow with better design of the corncer section 
- improved air flow with a bit wider cut out for the 3010 fan
- slighty more stabalised air flow fin, which now also has a small hole in it, to better reach on of the mount screws
- klicky mount is now a selectable add-on
- improved adapter plate design for easier printing

v1.7.3
- slight corrections 
- added print-support structures, so toolhead can now be printed without any supports

v1.7.2
- optimised duct so it would print dual-wall with a 0.6 nozzle
- slightly optimised heat insert cut-out

v1.7.1 improvment 
- added small air guiding restirctions to better cool the hotend

v1.7 improvments
- the goliath and extruder a pulled in 3mm, thereby pulling in the center of gravity
- redesigned stabiliser struts, so no supports are required for printing then
- those changes in turn required a redesign of the fan duct, which now also contains holes for heat inserts to secure it to the toolhead
- a clamp for the CPAP tube, which also contains the ADXL mount
- made some room on the back side of the toolhead and extruder adapter, to possibly and permanently mount an ADXL

I am keeping v1.6 as an older version, as the clearance on that is a bit more. Just in case / as per personal taste.
